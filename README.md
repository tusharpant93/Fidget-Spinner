# Fidget-Spinner

Hettinger, who first imagined the toy in the 1980s, first thought of it as a soft rock for youngsters to throw, but it was more than 20 years before the fidget spinner became the hottest toy of the spring and possible relief for some people suffering from anxiety and attention deficit problems.

#### Hettinger's patent on the original invention had expired early 2017, so the frenzy arrived a bit too late. 

That means Hasbro, for example, may sell their own versions of the toy without Hettinger, who claims she isn't disappointed about missing out on the toy industry's new craze.

Children, college students and adults alike are scooping up the toys as a way to help them focus or release nervous energy. They come in a variety of colors and sizes and are markedly inexpensive â€” most versions can be bought for less than $5, although some made with copper or other metals can be pricier.

Not only changing, how we look at the TANGIBILITY of a product/service but the whole product to disrupt the world of gaming.
